Cleveland had issued the bonds which Harrison had refused to issue; he
had sold $62,000,000 of these bonds at private sale, _at midnight_, to
J. P. Morgan and his associates; _the price was less than that which
the negroes of Jamaica were getting for their bonds!_

August Belmont was Morgan’s partner in that infamous deal. Therefore,
when Cleveland and Belmont got so close to Parker that he couldn’t
breathe without touching them on either side, the suspicion became
violent that the same Wall Street influences which had pledged
Cleveland to a bond issue had pledged Parker to the same thing.
